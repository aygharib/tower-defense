bugs:
    - enemies move across the screen too quickly

first version:
    - enemies that follow a pre-determined path
    - hit-scan towers


desired features:
    - Smart targetting: no wasted bullets for towers that already have projectiles that are lethal
    - large waves of enemies that are fed into the map one by one (not stacked)
    - slow projectiles that "lock and chase" onto their target, similar to a homing missile. maybe this can leave a trail. the idea is for this to be visually pleasing to see the projectiles make swirls and spirals in the map
    - enemies somehow react to music, maybe change their color, shape, size, vibrate
